Kung Feng is a graduate student pursuing a Masters in Public Policy at UC Berkeley and is a graduate student researcher with the Technology and Work team at the UC Berkeley Labor Center. His current research interests lie at the intersection of technology and work and include workers' data rights and AI regulation. He was previously the executive director of Jobs with Justice San Francisco, a labor community alliance organizing around worker power, housing rights and climate justice. At JWJSF, he was part of ground-breaking victories, including the Retail Worker Bill of Rights which launched fair scheduling laws around the country and Free City College, a model for free higher education. His recent efforts led to a major study of app workers in San Francisco with UC Santa Cruz that was cited in the official ballot argument against Prop 22 as well as in major news outlets like the New York Times and Washington Post. His contributions to the labor movement span over twenty years as a rank and file activist and as a union organizer.
